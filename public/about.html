        <h1>About Our Team</h1>
        <p>Because our class is quite small, we are happy to say, "We are number one!" as a team.</p>
        <p>Our team is based in West Michigan and consists of 3 members from Davenport University. Each member has varying levels of experience, however we are all studying web development at this time. Most of the team members will be graduating in less than a year.</p>
        <p>Any design work for logos, backgrounds, images, and work by others on the team or on the web is used only for educational purposes. Our developers work with content created by outside contractors who offer their services free of charge for many developers to create projects like this one. Any questions regarding our team's work can be expressed in an email on our <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a> page.</p>
